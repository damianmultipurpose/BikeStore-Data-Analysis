# BikeStore-Data-Analysis
An end-to-end data analysis project for a fictional bike store, leveraging SQL for database management and querying, Tableau for interactive data visualizations, and Excel for advanced data exploration. This project showcases key sales insights, customer behavior analysis, and store performance trends as part of my data analytics portfolio.
